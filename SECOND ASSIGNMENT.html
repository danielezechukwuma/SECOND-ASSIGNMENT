            <h2>Books Info</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>"The Death of Ivan Ilyich" by Leo Tolstoy follows the life and death of a successful Russian judge who, despite his accomplished career and social status, leads a meaningless and shallow existence. As he faces his own mortality, Ivan reflects on his past and the choices he made that led him to this point. He begins to understand that his pursuit of societal success and material wealth has left him with emptiness and regrets, leading him to question the very meaning of life itself. This powerful and thought-provoking novel delves into the themes of mortality, purpose, and the search for true fulfillment.</li> 
              <li>"Animal Farm" by George Orwell is a satirical novel that tells the story of a group of farm animals who overthrow their human owner and establish their own society based on equality and freedom. However, as the pigs in charge begin to adopt more and more human-like behaviors, they become corrupt and oppressive, forcing the other animals to work harder and live in fear. This allegorical novel serves as a commentary on the dangers of totalitarianism and the importance of standing up for one's rights and freedom.</li>
              <li>"Heart of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad follows the journey of a British steamship captain named Marlow who travels up the Congo River in search of a mysterious ivory trader named Kurtz. As he ventures deeper into the jungle, Marlow encounters the brutal realities of colonialism and discovers the unsettling truth about Kurtz's methods and motivations. This hauntingly evocative novel is a powerful examination of the darkness that lies within the human soul, as well as a critique of imperialism and the exploitation of native peoples.</li> 
              <li>"The Metamorphosis" by Franz Kafka tells the story of Gregor Samsa, a traveling salesman who wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a giant insect. As he struggles to come to terms with his new existence, he faces rejection and isolation from his family and society as a whole. This surreal and unsettling novella explores themes of identity, isolation, and the human condition, as well as the absurdity of everyday life.</li> 
              <li>"The Yellow Wallpaper" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman is a short story about a woman who is confined to her bedroom as part of a prescribed "rest cure" for her supposed nervoussness. As she begins to obsess over the patterns on the yellow wallpaper in her room, she begins to descend into madness, confronting the societal limitations placed on women at the time. This and chilling story is a commentary on the oppression of women and the importance of mental health and autonomy.</li> 
              <li>"The Old Man and the Sea" by Ernest Hemingway tells the story of an aging Cuban fisherman named Santiago who sets out on a solo fishing expedition and catches the biggest fish of his life. However, as he struggles to bring the massive marlin back to shore, he faces a battle of wills with the natural world and himself. This simple and meditative novella is a powerful reflection on the human experience, the struggle for survival, and the relationship between man and nature.</li> 
              <li>"The Outsider" by Albert Camus tells the story of Meursault, a detached and indifferent French Algerian who is accused of murder and sentenced to death. As he faces his impending execution, he reflects on the absurdity of human existence and the meaninglessness of life itself. This existentialist novel is a meditation on the human condition, the search for purpose, and the innate sense of isolation that comes with being alive.</li> 
              <li>"The Time Machine" by H.G. Wells is a science fiction novel about an inventor who creates a time machine. He travels to the future and encounters two species - the childlike Eloi and the animalistic Morlocks. He discovers that the Morlocks prey on the Eloi for food. He escapes but loses his time machine. He returns to the present and shares his story as a cautionary tale about social inequality and the consequences of neglecting others.</li> 
              <li>"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" by Muriel Spark tells the story of a charismatic and unconventional Scottish schoolteacher named Miss Jean Brodie, and the impact she has on the lives of her students. Through her unorthodox teaching methods and personal relationships, she challenges the norms of the conservative society of 1930s Edinburgh and sparks a series of events that prove to have serious consequences for those around her. This witty and provocative novel explores themes of morality, loyalty, and the quest for individuality.</li> 
              <li>"Breakfast at Tiffany's" by Truman Capote tells the story of Holly Golightly, a charming and enigmatic young woman who lives in New York City and longs for a life of luxury and glamour. Through her friendship with a struggling writer named Fred, she tries to navigate her complicated past and find a way to achieve her dreams. This classic novel is a timeless exploration of the search for love and identity in a world that can often be uncertain and unforgiving.</li>
              <li>"The Three Musketeers" a swashbuckling adventure novel featuring Dumas' iconic heroic trio and their battles against the corrupt Cardinal Richelieu.</li>
              <li>"Treasure Island" - a classic adventure novel following young Jim Hawkins and the search for buried treasure on a remote island.</li>
              <li>"Dracula" - a gothic horror novel that tells the story of the eponymous vampire, his battles against a group of people led by Professor Abraham Van Helsing, and his eventual defeat.</li>
              <li>"Frankenstein" — a cautionary tale about the dangers of scientific ambition and the limits of human knowledge.</li>
              <li>"Wuthering Heights"-a Gothic romance following the doomed love affair of Cathy and Heathcliff on the yorkshire moors.</li>
